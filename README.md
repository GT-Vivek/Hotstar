## Technologies we used

In this project, I have used the following technologies:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- React
- Node
- Express
- Mongoose

I have created this Hotstar website clone by using media queries which makes the project responsive.
the Main motive for cloning Hotstar.com was to create proper functionality and design like:
  -Backend - which was very helpful to manage data and routes.
  -React - which helped us to build frontend such as designing and structuring of website.
  -Hover Effects - styling all the buttons, images, etc.
